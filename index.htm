            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>
                Visualization techniques help me to remember people's faces, to note them friendly or not.
                I prefer to work with friendly people, those with helping tendencies, and those who do not mind with imperfections.
                I softly dislike those who are good at insulting, disbelieving, doubting, demanding, suspecting, and frustrated people
                I softly avoid these (un)kind of people. I welcome them if they bear a smile when meeting next time.
                Helping people bear a smile and make others happy too :)
            </p>
            <p>
                List of <a href="/unfriendly">unfriendly people</a> (i.e., they are not friendly yet) are avoid for better.
                And <a href="/friendly">friendly people</a> are the ones I like to see or speak.
                Sometimes, when I am busy I may not respond to see you or speak with you - I may be worried working on a problem -
                you can <a href="/friendly-request">put a friendly request</a> to get my attention (instead of crying like a baby :)
                and I shall definitely return to you with apologies.
                If you are not in one of the above lists, you are probably an <a href="/acquaintance">acquaintance</a> or haven't met yet.  You can make yourself friendly, by trying one of <a href="/apologizing">these</a>.
