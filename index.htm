        <p>Currently interested in companies that can employ me for the next three years with Facebook Application Development or Mobile/Google-Glass Application Development, JavaScript Development.</p>

            <message class="great"><strong>A word</strong> or sentence uttered can never be taken aback</message>
            <p>The best people are the friends who keep in touch with me from time to time.</p>
            <!--p>
                Visualization techniques help me to remember people's faces, to note them friendly or not.
                I prefer to work with friendly people, those with helping tendencies, and those who do not mind with imperfections.
                I softly dislike those who are good at insulting, disbelieving, doubting, demanding, suspecting, or frustrated people, and deadline-idiots.
                I softly avoid these (un)kind of people. I welcome them if they bear a smile when meeting next time.
                Helping people bear a smile and make others happy too :)
            </p>
            <p>
                List of <a href="/unfriendly">unfriendly people</a> (i.e., they are not friendly yet) are avoid for better.
                And <a href="/friendly">friendly people</a> are the ones I like to see or speak.
                Sometimes, when I am busy I may not respond to see you or speak with you - I may be worried working on a problem -
                you can <a href="/friendly-request">write a friendly request</a> to get my attention (instead of crying like a baby :)
                and I shall definitely return to you with apologies.
                If you are not in one of the above lists, you are probably an <a href="/acquaintance">acquaintance</a> or haven't met yet.  You can make yourself friendly, by trying one of <a href="/apologizing">these</a>.
                <h4>
                    Also, see if you <a href="/are-you-friendly">qualify for being friendly</a>.
